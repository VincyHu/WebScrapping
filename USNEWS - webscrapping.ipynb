       "'The United Kingdom is poised to leave the European Union on Jan. 31 after British lawmakers Thursday gave final approval to Prime Minister Boris Johnson\\'s Brexit bill.  The measure passed the House of Commons easily and without fanfare in an anticlimactic end to a chaotic, yearslong saga that began after U.K. citizens narrowly voted to leave the EU in 2016.  The withdrawal bill\\'s passage was expected: Lawmakers gave it initial approval in December after a general election that Johnson\\'s Conservative Party won decisively, picking up 66 seats in Parliament. Though the measure now heads to the House of Lords, Thursday\\'s vote essentially guarantees that Brexit will happen at the end of the month.  Parliament refused three times to pass former Prime Minister Theresa May\\'s Brexit bill, ultimately leading to her resignation. Lawmakers also declined to pass Johnson\\'s Brexit bill this fall, prompting him to call for an election.  Johnson\\'s Brexit bill is similar to May\\'s but replaces a provision known as the \"Irish backstop\" with what is essentially a customs border in the Irish sea, between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K.  The bill also provides for an 11-month transition period during which the U.K. will no longer be an EU member but will continue to follow its rules. The entities are expected to continue negotiations during that period, including those over the U.K.\\'s future trade relationship with the bloc.  '"
